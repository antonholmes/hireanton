_Custom Tag and Tooltip Programming Exercise!_

# :baseball: Motivation

For this exercise, I created a custom tag and tooltip hover similar to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

# ðŸ–± Functionality

Each question has a set of tags below it. The look and functionality of the final product should be as close to StackOverflow as possible. Some key features:

- Ability to autosize both the tag and tooltip window based on the contents or optionally specify the height and width
- Hovering over the tag for some number of milliseconds (configurable) will cause the tooltip to appear.
- Moving mouse from the tag to the tooltip allows you to interact with the tooltip (ie click on a button)
- Tooltip disappears after removing the mouse (hover).
- Tooltip has a default location below the tag, but if there is no room to display it below it will be displayed above.
